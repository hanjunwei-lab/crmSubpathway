## crmSubpathway: Identify cancer-related metabolic subpathways

> Description: The crmSubpathway package is a systematic biological tool to identify cancer-related metabolic subpathways. The main capabilities of this tool are as follows: 1. This function uses the k-clique algorithm to split the metabolic pathways in the KEGG database into metabolic subpathways. 2. A stable metabolic subpathway activity matrix is constructed by GSVA or ssGSEA methods. 3. Cancer-related metabolic subpathways are identified through differential analysis. 4. Visualization
