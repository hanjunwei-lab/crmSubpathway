## crmSubpathway: Identify cancer-related metabolic subpathways

> Description: The crmSubpathway package is a systematic biological tool to identify cancer-related metabolic subpathways. The main capabilities of this tool are as follows: </br>
1. This function uses the k-clique algorithm to split the metabolic pathways in the KEGG database into metabolic subpathways. </br>
2. A stable metabolic subpathway activity matrix is constructed by GSVA or ssGSEA methods.</br>
3. Cancer-related metabolic subpathways are identified through differential analysis.</br>
4. Visualization

## Installation: 
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("hanjunwei-lab/crmSubpathway")
useï¼šlibrary(crmSubpathway)
```
